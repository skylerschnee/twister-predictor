## Project Description:

Advancement in tornado casualty limiting technologies has made significant progress. These advancements include imporoved warning systems, updated building codes, public education, research, and community response. But how much are they helping?

Following the Data Science pipeline, we will discover if these advancements have made an effect on casualties due to tornadoes.

## Goals:

* Acquire the data
* Prepare the data 
* Explore the data to find drivers of our target variable (casualties)
* Build time-series models to forecast drivers of caualties
* Validate, and then test our best model
* Deliver findings to a group of fellow data scientists
